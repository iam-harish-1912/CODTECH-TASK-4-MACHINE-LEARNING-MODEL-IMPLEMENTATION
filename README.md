# 🤖 Project Overview: MACHINE LEARNING MODEL IMPLEMENTATION
🎯 Objective:

To implement a predictive machine learning model using Python's scikit-learn library that classifies emails as spam or ham (not spam) based on message content.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python Libraries: pandas – data handling scikit-learn – model building and evaluation CountVectorizer – text feature extraction MultinomialNB – classification model (Naive Bayes)

📁 Dataset:

SMS Spam Collection Dataset (e.g., from UCI or Kaggle) Contains labeled messages: “spam” or “ham”

🔍 Process Summary:

Load and clean the dataset Convert labels from text to binary values (ham = 0, spam = 1) Extract features from text using Bag-of-Words Train a Naive Bayes classifier using training data Evaluate the model using accuracy score and classification report

📈 Output:

Model predicts whether a message is spam or not Evaluation metrics like: Accuracy Precision, Recall, F1-score Confusion matrix

📌 Learning Outcomes:

Experience in applying machine learning classification algorithms Understanding of text preprocessing and feature extraction Hands-on practice with scikit-learn workflow Exposure to real-world NLP problems
